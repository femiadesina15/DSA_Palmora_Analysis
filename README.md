**Case Study 3: Palmora Analysis (DSA CAPSTONE PROJECT) - [Power Bi]** <br><br>
**Palmora Group HR Data Analysis Project – Summary** <br><br>
**Objective:**<br><br>
The aim of the Palmora Group project was to analyze employee data across multiple departments and branches to uncover insights about workforce distribution, performance, attrition, and satisfaction. The analysis helped the HR department make data-driven decisions to improve staff retention, engagement, and productivity.

**Key Areas of Analysis:** <br><br>
**1.	Employee Demographics**<br><br>
o	Breakdown by gender, education level, marital status, and department.<br>
o	Majority of employees are male, and the highest number of staff work in Operations and Sales.<br><br>
**2.	Departmental Performance**<br><br>
o	Compared performance ratings across departments.<br>
o	Highlighted departments with high or low average ratings, especially for potential retraining or recognition.<br><br>
**3.	Attrition Analysis**<br><br>
o	Identified reasons for employee exits (e.g., dissatisfaction, relocation, better offers).<br>
o	Tracked trends in attrition by age, job role, and length of service.<br>
o	Noted that younger employees (aged 26–35) were more likely to leave.<br><br>
**4.	Job Satisfaction & Work-Life Balance**<br><br>
o	Measured satisfaction scores across different job roles.<br>
o	Highlighted departments where work-life balance scores were lowest.<br><br>
**5.	Salary & Education Correlation**<br><br>
o	Analyzed if higher education correlated with higher income or performance.<br>
o	Found that postgraduate holders had slightly better performance ratings, but salary growth didn’t always match qualifications.<br><br>
**6.	KPIs & Dashboards**<br><br>
o	Built interactive Power BI dashboards to display:<br>
	Total Employees, Attrition Rate, Avg. Years at Company<br>
	Filters by Department, Gender, and Education Level<br>
	Visuals like bar charts, donut charts, and slicers for quick insights.<br>

**Recommendations:** <br><br>
•	Improve employee retention by enhancing benefits and internal growth opportunities for younger staff. <br>
•	Provide targeted training in departments with low performance scores. <br>
•	Investigate causes of low work-life balance in high-attrition units. <br>
•	Consider salary restructuring where disparities exist despite high qualifications or performance. <br><br>
